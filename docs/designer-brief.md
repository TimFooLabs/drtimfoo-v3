  📋 Immediate UI Design Tasks (Priority)

  1. Feature Components (60% Complete - Need UI)

  Booking System (Backend ✅, UI ⏳)
  - Booking form with date/time selection (use generated shadcn components)
  - Booking confirmation and management interfaces
  - User dashboard booking list

  Testimonials (Backend ✅, UI Partial)
  - Testimonial submission form
  - Testimonial display components with rating system
  - Featured testimonial management

  Contact Forms (Backend ✅, UI ⏳)
  - Contact form with rate limiting UI feedback
  - Admin contact management interface
  - Form validation and error states

  2. Admin Dashboard (Layout ✅, Pages ⏳)

  Management Interfaces
  - /admin/bookings - Booking management with status updates
  - /admin/testimonials - Testimonial approval workflow
  - /admin/contacts - Contact form management
  - Bulk actions and filtering interfaces

  🚨 CRITICAL: Component Development Workflow

  MANDATORY CLI-FIRST APPROACH

  # ALWAYS generate components first, never copy-paste
  bunx shadcn@latest add calendar form button select textarea toast

  # Then make custom edits as needed
  # Never use code snippets from implementation plan

  Why this matters:
  - Ensures latest shadcn updates and bug fixes
  - Maintains consistent styling and theming
  - Reduces component bugs and conflicts
  - Faster development workflow

  Required Components for Features:
  # For booking system
  bunx shadcn@latest add calendar form button select textarea toast

  # For admin dashboard  
  bunx shadcn@latest add table badge dropdown-menu dialog checkbox

  # For testimonials
  bunx shadcn@latest add card avatar alert separator
