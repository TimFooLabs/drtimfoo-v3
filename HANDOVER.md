# Handover Instructions: Clerk Authentication Integration

## Current Task Status

We're implementing Clerk authentication integration for the drtimfoo-v3 Next.js project. Here's the current status of the todo list:

1. ‚úÖ **Create or update src/proxy.ts with Clerk authMiddleware configuration** - COMPLETED
2. ‚úÖ **Implement src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts for webhook handling** - COMPLETED
3. ‚úÖ **Fix Clerk webhook signature verification issues** - COMPLETED
4. ‚úÖ **Review and align src/lib/convex/server.ts with the plan if needed** - COMPLETED
5. ‚úÖ **Ensure TypeScript strict compliance with proper type imports** - COMPLETED
6. ‚úÖ **Verify .env.example includes all required Clerk variables** - COMPLETED
7. ‚úÖ **Clean up any obsolete scaffold files** - COMPLETED

**üéâ ALL TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/proxy.ts`
- Implemented Clerk middleware using `clerkMiddleware` and `createRouteMatcher` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- Configured public routes: `/`, `/about`, `/services`, `/blog(.*)`, `/contact`, `/api/webhooks(.*)`
- Added protection for non-public routes using async/await pattern

### 2. `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`
- Implemented webhook handler for Clerk user events
- Added `svix` package for webhook verification
- Integrated with Convex to create/update users on `user.created` and `user.updated` events
- **Fixed signature verification issues**:
  - Added automatic trailing newline handling for Svix compatibility
  - Implemented timestamp tolerance validation (5 minutes)
  - Enhanced raw body processing to preserve exact payload formatting
  - Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 3. `package.json`
- Added `svix` dependency for webhook verification

## Recent Fixes

### Clerk Webhook Signature Verification (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: JSON formatting mismatch causing Svix verification failures
- **Root Cause**: Missing trailing newlines and inconsistent payload formatting
- **Solution**: Updated webhook handler to automatically handle trailing newlines and validate timestamps
- **Testing**: Created debug artifacts (`*_simple.json`, `*_debug_curl.sh`) for consistent testing
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Webhook verification now passes consistently

## Current Issues

**‚úÖ NO ISSUES - All identified issues have been resolved**

**Previous Issue Resolution:**
- **src/lib/convex/server.ts**: The handover incorrectly stated this file needed updates. Analysis confirmed it already uses the modern `auth()` API correctly and doesn't need changes.

## Next Steps

**üéØ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

All integration tasks have been successfully completed:

1. ‚úÖ **src/lib/convex/server.ts** - Already using modern `auth()` API correctly
2. ‚úÖ **.env.example** - All required Clerk variables documented
3. ‚úÖ **TypeScript compliance** - Passes strict mode compilation
4. ‚úÖ **Code quality** - Linting issues addressed
5. ‚úÖ **Next.js 16 compatibility** - Updated webhook config for App Router

## Implementation Plan Reference

The implementation is based on the `docs/implementation-plan.md` file, specifically:
- Lines 1548-1568 for proxy configuration
- Lines 1573-1632 for webhook implementation
- Lines 1498-1540 for server-side helpers

## Environment Variables

Make sure these Clerk environment variables are configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` (for webhook verification)

## Testing

After completing the implementation:
1. Test authentication flow
2. Verify webhook endpoints are working
3. Check Convex integration with Clerk user data

## Testing Status

### Webhook Testing
- ‚úÖ Clerk webhook signature verification now passes
- ‚úÖ Test suite generates proper debug artifacts
- ‚úÖ Timestamp validation implemented and working
- ‚úÖ Payload formatting issues resolved

### Convex Integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Convex warning appears when dataset is empty (expected behavior)
- ‚úÖ User creation/update mutations working correctly

## Notes

- The project uses Clerk v6.34.0
- We're using Bun as the package manager
- The implementation follows the latest Clerk API patterns
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Webhook handler now includes enhanced security checks (timestamp tolerance)
- **Next.js 16 Migration**: The project now uses `src/proxy.ts` instead of `src/middleware.ts` for authentication middleware
