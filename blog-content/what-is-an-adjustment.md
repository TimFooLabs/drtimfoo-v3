The chiropractic adjustment. It’s many things to many people. Some people squirm, some people find absolute relaxation from it. I’ve been fortunate enough to have patients from both extremes. It’s fascinating to see the variety of responses and very heartwarming to be part of their growth.

Classically, the chiropractic adjustment refers to the small but quick thrust gently delivered to a joint. In the research it’s called a “High Velocity Low Amplitude” (HVLA) thrust which clocks ~200m/s.

In the chiro world, this is done after a thorough history-taking and examination that would culminate with a diagnosis. The aim is to rule out any serious underlying pathology, determine if further imaging (X-Ray, CT, MRI) or referrals are needed.

To me, HVLA is one tool (in most cases, the most efficient tool) to get the job done. It is a brilliant way to affect the nervous system.

**How it works**

The adjustment sends input to the brain by activating receptors in the spine which then send signals up various tracts in the spinal cord. Some signals cause reflexive responses at the level of adjustment (eg. muscle relaxation). And, very excitingly, others ultimately end up in different parts of the brain!

That is why chiropractic works. That’s the _science_ part. Don’t forget there is also the _art_, and _philosophy_ that together form the 3 aspects of chiropractic.

The main aim of this post is to introduce the chiropractic adjustment to you. I want to let you know the intention and rigorous investigation that takes place before delivering one. And finally, to very simplistically explain what happens in your body when the adjustment is given.

I have found a helpful video that explains Chiropractic quite simply:
