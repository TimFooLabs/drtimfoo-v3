The videos below are 6min and 15min Guided Formal Breathing Meditation. Find a quiet place and give it a try!

# Overview

**WHAT IS IT?**

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (or MBSR) is a group program that was developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the 1970s to treat patients struggling with life’s difficulties and physical and/or mental illness (Kabat-Zinn, 2013). Although it was initially created to aid hospital patients, it has wide applicability and has been used by a broad range of people from all walks of life.

**TIME REQUIRED**

15 minutes daily for at least a week (though evidence suggests that mindfulness increases the more you practice it).

**HOW TO DO IT**

The most basic way to do mindful breathing is simply to focus your attention on your breath, the inhale and exhale. You can do this while standing, but ideally you’ll be sitting or even lying in a comfortable position. Your eyes may be open or closed, but you may find it easier to maintain your focus if you close your eyes. It can help to set aside a designated time for this exercise, but it can also help to practice it when you’re feeling particularly stressed or anxious.Experts believe a regular practice of mindful breathing can make it easier to do it in difficult situations.
