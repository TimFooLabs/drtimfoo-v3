Markdown Content:
This routine is recommended for patients under chiropractic care. Feel free to try this at home to maintain your own spine, but if any pain is encountered, please consult your healthcare practitioner. Always avoid positions that aggravate any pain. You will also note that all static stretches will follow a strict 30 second hold. Research has shown that a MINIMUM of 30 seconds is necessary to reap the benefits of any given static stretch. Use a timer or if you are counting in your head, count to 50 seconds because most of us count faster than we think.**Existing patients with an active rehab program, remember to bring your rehab workbook/worksheet to your appointments!**

**Supine Bridge**

This is a reverse plank and a more advanced exercise. Lie on your back. Ensure there is a small arch in your back. Tighten your tummy and your bums. Ensure that as you tighten, your continue to breath normally. When ready, keep your tummy tight, squeeze your bums and thrust your hips into the sky.

**Prayer Cat Camel**

Start in a neutral position with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. As you breathe out, go into a prayer position (bringing your bums toward your heels, feel the stretch in your low back). As you breathe in, go into a cat stretch (dropping your tummy towards the floor and looking up into the sky). As you breathe out, go into a camel stretch (imagine your upper back rising towards the sky). As you breathe in, go back into neutral position. Check that your hands are still directly under your shoulders, and your knees are still under your hips.

- Repeat this cycle 10 times.

- Breathe slowly and intentionally. Don’t rush this.
