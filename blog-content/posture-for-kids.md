As adults, we are victims of postural degradation, be it in an office or whilst standing up. Do you know that the safety of children’s postures is also not as different as an adult? You may not realize it, but children are postural victims of the school system, just like an adult being postural victims of their career.

You have probably seen primary school children carrying backpacks twice the size of the bodies, watch television or play video games with an improper posture. This is a situation that must not be overlooked as it will affect their po­­sture in the future which can lead to symptoms like scoliosis.

Fortunately, postural distortions can be prevented from as young as 6 years old. Thus, take the following precautions to ensure that your child or the children around you are protecting their spine!

- Once your child reaches 6 years old, they should undergo postural examinations.

- Children should undergo a postural analysis at least once per year for early detection of postural distortions or signs of scoliosis.

- In school, children should take frequent posture breaks in between classes. Just take a quick 10 minutes for a mini stretching for the spine before the next class!

- Children should not carry backpacks exceeding 10% of their body weight. This causes stress to the spine and back muscles. Ensure that you supervise what they put in their school bags.

- Limit the amount of time your child can watch TV or play video games. Instead of staying indoors, go outside for an energising time together!
