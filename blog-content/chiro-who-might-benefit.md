# Who Might Benefit From Chiropractic

The benefits of chiropractic are far reaching. It is honestly very difficult to say who might benefit. It very much depends on your own goals. Like many things in life, the limit really is set by the person living it.

It may be stiffness, with or without pain. Or a dull ache that just doesn’t go away. There are ways to tackle every one of them. The speed and quality of recovery are based on a complexity of life factors, some modifiable, some unfortunately not.

The real question then might be: “Will**I**benefit from chiropractic?” This question is hard to address comprehensively because each individual is unique.

As a guide however, here are some broad groups of people (loosely based around pain) that have already benefited from chiropractic care:

- Neck pain sufferers

- Headache sufferers

- Low back pain sufferers

- Shoulder pain sufferers

- Tennis elbow sufferers

- Runners (knee pain, ITB issues, patella tracking dysfunction, plantar fascitis)

- Basketball/soccer players (knee and ankle pain)

The list goes on to stressed out people, office workers, elderly, athletes… what role you have in life isn’t as important as the _level you function_ at in that role. Do you fall into any of these categories?

Hope this helps=)
