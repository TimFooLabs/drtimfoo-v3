**What is Chiropractic?**

You’ve heard of the term chiropractic, but what is the whole picture? How does it work, what are its benefits and who should seek this form of treatment?

In a sentence, chiropractic is a total and preventive approach focused on treating spinal and musculoskeletal problems primarily through manual manipulation. Because your nervous system affects all parts of your body, misalignments of the spine can cause poor health, even in areas far from the spine itself. This is where chiropractic treatment comes in. Being a natural form of health care that uses spinal adjustments to correct these misalignments, chiropractic restores proper function to the nervous system. This helps your body to heal naturally, thus making you _feel_ better and _be_ better.

**How does Chiropractic work?**

Chiropractic does away with drugs or surgery. It instead uses the application of a precise force to a specific spinal segment. This corrects any misalignments, permitting normal nerve transmission and ultimately aids the body to recuperate on its own. The correction of spinal dysfunction and subluxation is called the chiropractic adjustment.

Diagnosis forms an important part of the entire chiropractic process. The specific needs of the patient are identified before the chiropractor develops and carries out a comprehensive treatment plan. Other than the chiropractic care itself, therapeutic exercise and other non-invasive therapies such as soft tissue therapy, vibration, ultrasound, nutritional and lifestyle counseling may be provided.

**What are the benefits of Chiropractic?**

**Who should seek Chiropractic treatment?**

Chiropractic is safe and effective for all ages. From the young to the pregnant to the elderly. Ensuring the spine and nervous system are working in harmony is important for everyone.

For pregnant women, chiropractic care during pregnancy allows for a healthier pregnancy, easier delivery, and provides support for the mother and fetus. One of the common treatments is the alignment of the pelvis, which decreases stress on the baby and mother (“Pregnancy and chiropractic: a narrative review of the literature”[J Chiropr Med](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647084/#). 2007 Spring; 6(2): 70–74).

Regular chiropractic check-ups for adolescents establishes a lifelong routine of health ([research articles](http://icpa4kids.org/Chiropractic-Research/treatment-related-aggravations-complications-and-improvements-attributed-to-chiropractic-spinal-manipulative-therapy-of-pediatric-patients-a-survey-of-parents.html)). Many adolescents are also susceptible to spinal injury due to sports or the developing body, which makes visits to the chiropractor more vital.

Adults often seek chiropractic care only when they have an injury. However, regular visits to the chiropractor can prevent many conditions and injuries, and make sure the nervous system is function optimally.

The elderly are many clinic’s most regular patients and with good reasons. The elderly require effective treatment with as little discomfort as possible. Skilled chiropractors can relieve wide-ranging bodily issues with as little discomfort as possible through non-invasive measures (“The role of chiropractic care in older adults”[Chiropr Man Therap](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306193/#). 2012; 20: 3.).
