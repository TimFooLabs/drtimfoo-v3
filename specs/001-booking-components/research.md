# Phase 0 Research: Booking Components Implementation

**Feature**: Complete Booking Feature Implementation - Missing Components
**Date**: 2025-01-24
**Researcher**: Claude Code Agent

## Research Summary

All technical questions have been resolved through analysis of existing project structure, dependencies, and patterns. The implementation will build upon established conventions and leverage existing infrastructure.

## Technical Decisions

### Component Architecture

**Decision**: Build components as individual, reusable React components following shadcn/ui patterns

**Rationale**:
- Existing booking-form.tsx already uses shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Form, Calendar)
- Project has established patterns for component organization under `src/components/features/`
- shadcn/ui provides accessibility-compliant base components
- Allows independent testing and deployment of each component

**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic booking component (rejected: violates independent testability)
- Custom component library (rejected: unnecessary complexity)

### State Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use existing Convex hooks (useUserBookings, useCreateBooking, useUpcomingBookings) for data management

**Rationale**:
- Hooks already implemented in `src/lib/convex/client.ts`
- Provides real-time data synchronization as required by constitution
- Consistent with existing booking-form.tsx patterns
- Eliminates need for additional state management libraries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux/Zustand (rejected: overkill for feature scope)
- Local component state only (rejected: violates real-time sync requirement)

### Styling Approach

**Decision**: Continue with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui component system

**Rationale**:
- Project already configured with Tailwind v4 and OKLCH palette
- shadcn/ui components provide consistent design system
- Existing booking-form.tsx establishes visual patterns
- Meets accessibility requirements with proper contrast ratios

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules (rejected: inconsistent with project patterns)
- Styled-components (rejected: not in current dependency stack)

### Data Fetching Patterns

**Decision**: Leverage Convex real-time queries with proper loading and error states

**Rationale**:
- Constitution requires real-time data synchronization
- Existing hooks provide loading states automatically
- Convex handles offline/online synchronization
- Consistent with current project architecture

**Alternatives considered**:
- REST API calls (rejected: violates real-time sync requirement)
- SWR/React Query (rejected: unnecessary with Convex real-time)

## Integration Points

### Authentication Integration

**Approach**: Use existing Clerk authentication patterns from booking-form.tsx

- Clerk provides user authentication state
- Convex user queries already filter by authenticated user
- No additional auth configuration needed

### Routing Integration

**Approach**: Extend existing Next.js App Router patterns

- Booking confirmation page: `/booking/confirmation` (already referenced in booking-form.tsx)
- Booking history: integrate into existing user dashboard or create dedicated page
- Components designed for embedding in multiple layouts

### Form Validation

**Approach**: Continue with react-hook-form and zod validation patterns

- Existing booking-form.tsx uses this combination
- Provides type-safe validation
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading Optimization

- Implement skeleton loading states for booking history
- Use Convex's efficient real-time queries
- Lazy load booking history components
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Bundle Size Management

- Leverage existing shadcn/ui components
- Avoid adding new heavy dependencies
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratios for status indicators (SC-004)
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (FR-007)
- Provide proper ARIA labels for booking status information
- Use semantic HTML5 elements

### Screen Reader Support

- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Provide descriptive text for booking status icons
- Ensure form validation errors are properly announced
- Implement focus management for dynamic content

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Vitest)

- Test individual component rendering
- Validate form validation logic
- Test status badge variations
- Mock Convex hooks for isolated testing

### Integration Testing (Playwright)

- End-to-end booking flow: form → confirmation
- Booking history display and filtering
- Authentication flow integration
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Accessibility Testing

- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing
- Color contrast validation

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Control

- Leverage Clerk authentication for user isolation
- Convex queries automatically filter by user ID
- No sensitive data exposure in client components
- Proper error handling without data leakage

### Input Validation

- Server-side validation in Convex mutations
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Sanitization of user-generated content
- Proper handling of malformed booking references

## Unknowns Resolved

All technical questions have been answered through analysis of existing project patterns:

✅ **Component structure**: Follow existing `src/components/features/booking/` pattern
✅ **State management**: Use existing Convex hooks
✅ **Styling**: Continue with Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
✅ **Authentication**: Leverage existing Clerk integration
✅ **Testing**: Use Vitest + Playwright (already configured)
✅ **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (specified in success criteria)
✅ **Performance**: Meet specified loading time requirements

**No blockers identified - ready to proceed to Phase 1 design**
