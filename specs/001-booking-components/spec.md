# Feature Specification: Complete Booking Feature Implementation - Missing Components

**Feature Branch**: `001-booking-components`
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Complete Booking Feature Implementation - Missing Components"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Booking Confirmation Display (Priority: P1)

After submitting a booking form, users need to see a confirmation page that summarizes their appointment details and provides reassurance that their booking was successful.

**Why this priority**: This is the immediate next step after form submission and provides essential closure to the booking process. Without it, users are left uncertain about their booking status.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a booking form and verifying the confirmation page displays correct booking details, status, and next steps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user successfully submits a booking form, **When** they are redirected to the confirmation page, **Then** they see their booking details (service type, date, time, notes), confirmation status, and next steps
2. **Given** a user navigates directly to the confirmation URL without a recent booking, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an appropriate message directing them to book an appointment
3. **Given** a booking is confirmed in the system, **When** the confirmation page loads, **Then** all booking information matches what was submitted in the form

### User Story 2 - Personal Booking History Management (Priority: P1)

Authenticated users need to view their complete booking history to manage upcoming appointments and review past bookings.

**Why this priority**: This is core functionality for user self-service and booking management. Users expect to be able to see their appointment history and current bookings.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a user with multiple bookings and verifying the booking list displays all past and upcoming bookings with correct status information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user with existing bookings, **When** they view their booking history, **Then** they see all their bookings organized chronologically with status indicators
2. **Given** a user with no bookings, **When** they view their booking history, **Then** they see an empty state message encouraging them to book their first appointment
3. **Given** a user with upcoming bookings, **When** they view their booking list, **Then** they can easily distinguish upcoming from past bookings and see relevant action options

---

### User Story 3 - Booking Status Clarity (Priority: P2)

Users need clear, consistent visual indicators for booking status across all interfaces to understand their appointment state at a glance.

**Why this priority**: Status clarity is essential for user experience but can be refined after core functionality is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing bookings with different statuses and verifying each status has a distinct, accessible visual representation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a booking with "pending" status, **When** displayed in any interface, **Then** it shows a distinct visual indicator that is clearly different from other statuses
2. **Given** a booking with "confirmed" status, **When** displayed, **Then** it shows positive visual styling indicating successful booking
3. **Given** a booking with "cancelled" status, **When** displayed, **Then** it shows clear visual indication that the appointment is not happening
4. **Given** a booking with "completed" status, **When** displayed, **Then** it shows visual indication that the appointment has occurred

---

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Date Selection (Priority: P3)

Users may benefit from an improved calendar interface for selecting booking dates, especially if the basic calendar needs additional features for better usability.

**Why this priority**: This is an enhancement that improves user experience but is not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by interacting with the calendar interface and verifying date selection behavior and visual feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is selecting a booking date, **When** they interact with the calendar, **Then** unavailable dates are clearly indicated and cannot be selected
2. **Given** a user selects a valid date, **When** they interact with the calendar, **Then** their selection is clearly highlighted and persists across interface interactions
3. **Given** the calendar displays multiple months, **When** users navigate between months, **Then** the navigation is smooth and maintains their current selection context

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access booking history while not authenticated?
- How does the system handle booking confirmation display for very old or non-existent booking IDs?
- What happens when booking status data is corrupted or missing from the database?
- How are timezone differences handled for booking confirmation display?
- What happens when a user has an extremely large number of bookings (hundreds)?
- How does the system behave when real-time synchronization is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when a user's browser timezone changes during an active session?
- How are booking conflicts resolved when multiple users attempt to book the same time slot?
- What happens when the booking database reaches maximum capacity?
- How does the system handle partial data corruption in booking records?
