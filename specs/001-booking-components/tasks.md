# Tasks: Complete Booking Feature Implementation - Missing Components

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-booking-components/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included based on constitution requirements for Test-First Development

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create TypeScript types file in src/components/features/booking/types.ts
- [x] T002 [P] Verify required shadcn/ui components are available (badge, skeleton, separator, alert)
- [x] T003 Create booking features directory structure in src/components/features/booking/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Implement booking status badge component in src/components/features/booking/booking-status-badge.tsx (US3 - foundational component)
- [x] T005 Create unit tests for booking status badge in tests/unit/components/features/booking/booking-status-badge.test.tsx

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 3 - Booking Status Clarity (Priority: P2) 🎯 FOUNDATION

**Goal**: Provide clear, consistent visual indicators for booking status across all interfaces

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing bookings with different statuses and verifying each status has a distinct, accessible visual representation

### Tests for User Story 3 (REQUIRED) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 3 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - FOUNDATION for other stories
- **User Stories 1 & 2 (Phases 4-5)**: Depend on US3 completion - Can run in parallel
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US3 completion - Can run independently
- **Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 3 (Status Badge)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 1 (Confirmation)**: Can start after US3 completion - Uses status badge component
- **User Story 2 (History)**: Can start after US3 completion - Uses status badge component
- **User Story 4 (Calendar)**: Can start after US3 completion - Optional enhancement

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Core component implementation before integration
- Status badge integration before other features
- Responsive design and accessibility after core functionality
- Each story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once US3 is complete, US1 and US2 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Integration tasks in Phase 7 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories 1 & 2

```bash
# Launch all implementation tasks for User Stories 1 & 2 together (after US3 complete):
Task: "Create booking confirmation component in src/components/features/booking/booking-confirmation.tsx"
Task: "Create booking list component in src/components/features/booking/booking-list.tsx"
Task: "Implement booking data fetching and display logic in confirmation component"
Task: "Implement user bookings data fetching and filtering in booking list component"

# Launch status badge integration for both stories together:
Task: "Integrate booking status badge in confirmation component"
Task: "Integrate booking status badges in booking list component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 3, 1, 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 3 (Status Badge)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Status Badge component independently
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (Confirmation)
6. Complete Phase 5: User Story 2 (History)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both user stories independently
8. Deploy/demo core booking functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 3 → Test status badge independently → Deploy/Demo
3. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Enhanced)
6. Complete Integration & Polish → Final production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Developer A: User Story 3 (Status Badge) - MUST be first
3. Once US3 complete:
   - Developer B: User Story 1 (Confirmation)
   - Developer C: User Story 2 (History)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Calendar) - optional
4. Stories complete and integrate independently
5. Team works together on Integration & Polish

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach per constitution)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **CRITICAL**: User Story 3 (Status Badge) must be completed before User Stories 1, 2, and 4
- ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: All core booking components completed successfully with full TypeScript compliance, accessibility features, and comprehensive testing.
